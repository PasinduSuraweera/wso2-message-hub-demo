### **4. 💼 Interview Questions & Answers**

**Q: What problem does this solve?**
> *"In enterprise environments, different message types need to route to different services. This creates a unified API that intelligently routes based on content, reducing coupling and improving scalability."*

**Q: Why WSO2 MI?**
> *"WSO2 MI is enterprise-grade software used by Fortune 500 companies. It provides battle-tested integration patterns, monitoring, and scalability features that homegrown solutions lack."*

**Q: How would this scale?**
> *"The architecture supports horizontal scaling, load balancers, clustering, and can integrate with message queues for async processing. WSO2 MI is designed for enterprise-scale throughput."*

**Q: What about security?**
> *"WSO2 MI supports OAuth 2.0, JWT tokens, API keys, rate limiting, and enterprise security patterns. The foundation is there to implement any required security model."*
